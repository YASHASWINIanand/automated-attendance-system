# Automated Attendance Tracking System with Data Analysis

## Overview

This project implements an automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition technology. It utilizes the OpenCV face recognition library for real-time identification, and integrates with openpyxl to record attendance in Excel sheets. Additionally, Power BI is employed for in-depth data analysis and visualization.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Recognition:** Uses OpenCV to detect and recognize student faces.
- **Automated Attendance Logging:** Records attendance in an Excel sheet using the openpyxl library.
- **Data Analysis & Reporting:** Generates attendance reports and insights using Power BI.
- **Scalable & Customizable:** Adaptable to various institutional requirements with minimal manual effort.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- openpyxl
- pandas
- Power BI (for analysis and visualization)
